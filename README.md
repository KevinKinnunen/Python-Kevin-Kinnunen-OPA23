## Virtual Environment
- Create a virtual environment using the following command:
 ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
- Activate the virtual environment: 
```bash
source .venv/scripts/activate # On Windows
```
- Deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

**Note:** Make sure to run these commands in the activated virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.
**requirements.txt** includes all the packages to install for your venv.
- Install the packages from the file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
